# **Chess Game Using MASM/TASM (x8086)**  

## **Project Overview**  
This is a high-quality chess game built using TASM (Turbo Assembler) for the x8086 architecture. Despite the limitations of assembly language, the game delivers visually rich graphics by loading images as binary files and renders smoothly on execution. The game logic is efficiently managed using minimal data structures and supports:  

- **Two-player mode via LAN connection**  
- **Real-time chat between players**  
- **Optimized chess logic with efficient memory usage**

## **Key Features**  

- **High-Quality Graphics:** Images are rendered by reading and displaying binary image data, resulting in smooth, visually appealing gameplay.  
- **Efficient Chess Logic:** Compact yet powerful chess logic implemented using only a few arrays.  
- **Two-Player LAN Mode:** Seamlessly connect two players over a LAN network.  
- **In-Game Chat:** Communicate with your opponent in real-time during the game.  
- **Optimized Performance:** Designed for efficiency on the x8086 architecture using assembly code.
